PROJECT TODO LIST

1. Completely remove the transition-all mixin. As using transition all is suboptimal in terms of performance.
    - Either rewrite the mixin to transition properties supplied to the mixin, or just define them normally within their respective rule.
    - If using a mixin, it would need to be able to accept at least 2 arguments. However the second argument could be null as it may not be required.
      Although this method is not very flexible because it limits us to transitioning at most 2 properties.
2. Finish cleaning up sass files (Remove over nesting, add comments etc.)
3. Add more sass subfolders as per project specifications.
